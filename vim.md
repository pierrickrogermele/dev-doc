VIM
===

## Install

```bash
./configure --with-features=big --disable-gui 
```

## Configuration

To reload vimrc:
```vim
source $MYVIMRC
```

To known path of vimrc file:
```vim
echo $MYVIMRC
```

To get home:
```vim
echo $HOME
```

`MYVIMRC` is `$HOME/.vimrc` in UNIX and `$HOME/_vimrc` in Windows.
Be careful that under Windows, *gVim* installs a global `_vimrc` inside its installation directory.

## Modeline

Vim settings inside a file:
```java
// vi: ts=4 et
```

## Tabulation

Tabstop (width of columns for tab mode):
```vim
set tabstop=4
set ts=4
```

Softtabstop (?):
```vim
set softtabstop=2
```

Insert spaces instead of tabs:
```vim
set expandtab
set et
set noet " set to false
```

Converting current buffer to the current tab settings:
```vim
retab
```

In order to see tabulation in editor (this will also display all other hidden characters):
```vim
set list
set nolist
```

You can also use the whitespace highlighting syntax, that prints spaces in red and tabs in green:
```vim
set syntax=whitespace
```

## Gui

Set GUI off (menu, toolbars, ...):
```
:se go=
```

set modelines=5
```

Examples in C:
```c
/* vim: ft=C
 */
/* vi: ft=C
 */
/* vi: set ft=C: */

a number      | Work on the line whose number you give.
%             | The whole file.

g  | Replace all occurrences in the line. Without this, Vim replaces only the first occurrences in each line.
i  | Ignore case for the search pattern.
I  | Don't ignore case.
c  | Confirm each substitution. You can type y to substitute this match, n to skip this match, a to substitute this and all the remaining matches ("Yes to all"), and q to quit substitution.

----------------- | ------------------------------
`:s/OLD/NEW`      | First occurrence on current line.
`:s/OLD/NEW/g`    | Globally (all) on current line.

While grouping, the character `&` replaces the whole match.

## Syntax highlighting

 * [Create your own syntax files](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Creating_your_own_syntax_files).

To turn syntax highlighting on and off:
```vim
syntax on
syntax off
```

For colors, see <http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_06.html>.

Set filetype (determines rules to apply for syntax highlighting):
```vim
setf <language>
setf java
setf c
set filetype=html
```

Rules on file creation or opening :
```vim
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.html,*.htm set filetype=php
au BufRead,BufNewFile ~/project_y/*.html set filetype=php
```

Colorscheme:
```vim
colorscheme         " display current colorscheme name
colorscheme morning
color morning
color default       " default colorscheme
```

Installing user color schemes:
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/colors
cp mycolorscheme.vim $HOME/.vim/colors
```

Embedded syntax highlighting (syntax highlighting of code embedded inside another language code):
```bash
runtime! syntax/xml.vim
unlet b:current_syntax
syntax include @Python syntax/python.vim
syntax region pythonCode  start=+<Python>+ keepend end=+</Python>+  contains=@Python
```

## Vimscript

### Running vim commands

One can run vim command directly inside a vimscript:
```vim
mkspell ~/.vim/spell/en.utf-8.add
```

However if you must use a variable this isn't possible, because in a vim command variables are not interpreted. You must use the `exec` vimscript command:
```vim
exec "mkspell " . myfile
```

### For

```vim
for i in [1 2 5 70]
endfor
```

### Strings

To concatenate strings:
```vim
let myvar = "somestring" . somevar . "some other string"
```

### File system

Testing if a file exists:
```vim
if filereadable(myfile)
endif
```

Getting the modification time of a file:
```vim
let modiftime = getftime(myfile)
```

To get a correct path to a file/dir using `~`, use the `expand` keyword:
```vim
let wordsfile = expand("~/.vim/spell/en.utf-8.add")
```

### Variables & co

See <http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/19.html#options-as-variables>.

Append to a list or string:
```vim
set myopt+=myval
```
	
Insert at beginning of list or string:
```vim
set myopt^=myval
```

### Options

Options can be set either with set or let:
```vim
set myopt = 10
let &myopt = 10
```
The advantage of using `let`, is that you can make computation:
```vim
let &myopt = someothervar + 10 + z
```

Setting a boolean option:
```vim
set cindent
```

Unsetting a boolean option (prefix with 'no'):
```vim
set nocindent
```

Testing an option in .vim script:
```vim
if &filetype == 'java'
```

Many options have a shortcut, like filetype:
```vim
set ft=C
```

For printing an option:
```vim
set myopt
echo &myopt
```

For printing a variable:
```vim
echo myvar
```

## Printing
	
Printing from vi:
```vim
hardcopy
ha
```
Can be applied to a range of lines.
	
Printing in landscape mode:
```vim
se popt=portrait:n
```
	
Printing from command line:
```bash
vim -c hardcopy -c quit <myfile>
```
	
Output to a postscript file, with syntax highlighting:
```bash
vim -c 'hardcopy >myfile.ps' -c quit <myfile>
```
	
Turn off header on printer output:
```bash
vim -c 'set popt+=header:0' ...
```
	
Set font size:
```bash
vim -c 'set pfn=:h16' ...
```

## Shell command

Running a shell command:
```vim
:!mycommand
```

## Sort text

```vim
:%sort
```

Reverse sort:
```vim
sort!
```

Uniq:

```

Ignore case:

```

Use external sort:
```vim
exe  "%!LC_ALL=fr_FR." . &fileencoding . " sort"
```

## Statusline
	
```vim
set laststatus=2
set statusline=%n:%<%F%Y%R%=%l(%P)
```

Flag | Description
---- | ----------------

## Grep

### Internal vim grep command

```vim

```vim
fgrep
rfgrep
egrep
regrep
agrep

```

## Error format

To add a new error format:
```vim
set errorformat+=%*[\"]%f%*[\"]\\,\ line\ %l:\ %m
```

```

Command | Description
------- | -------------------
`d`     | Make a directory.

Getting current directory:
```vim
