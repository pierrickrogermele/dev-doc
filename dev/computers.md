## Processors

### Dynamic execution

Dynamic execution, or *out-of-order* execution, is a technique used in processors that reorders instructions according to the availability of data. It can be viewed as a hardware based dynamic recompilation or just-in-time compilation (JIT) to improve instruction scheduling. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_executionr).

A classical processor, that does not provide dynamic execution, is said to be an *in-order* processor.
