	ABSTRACT={A major goal in systems biology is a comprehensive description the entirety of all complex interactions between different types of biomolecules - also referred to as the interactome - and how these interactions give rise to higher, cellular and organism level functions or diseases.
		Numerous efforts have been undertaken to define such interactomes experimentally, for example yeast-tow-hybrid based protein-protein interaction networks or ChIP-seq based protein-DNA interactions for individual proteins.
			To complement these direct measurements, genome-scale quantitative multi-omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.)  enable researchers to predict novel functional interactions between molecular species.
			Moreover, these data allow to distinguish relevant functional from non-functional interactions in a specific biological context. 
			However, integration of multi-omics data is not straight forward due to their heterogeneity.
			So far, interaction networks have mostly been inferred from homogeneous functional data (e.g. gene co-expression networks) and novel methods are essential for inferring comprehensive regulatory networks across omics data types.

			Here we review state-of-the-art techniques for inferring the topology of interaction networks from functional multi-omics data, encompassing graphical models with multiple node types and quantitative-trait-loci (QTL) based approaches. 
			In addition, we will discuss Bayesian aspects of network inference, which allow for leveraging already established biological information, such as known protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions, to guide the inference process.}

	abstract="Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.",

The SCDE allows users to consistently describe, share and compare CSC data at the gene and pathway level. Our initial focus has been on carefully curating tissue and cancer stem cell-related experiments from blood, intestine and brain to create a high quality resource containing 53 public studies and 1098 assays. The experimental information is captured and stored in the multi-omics Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA-Tab) format and can be queried in the data repository. A linked Galaxy framework provides a comprehensive, flexible environment populated with novel tools for gene list comparisons against molecular signatures in GeneSigDB and MSigDB, curated experiments in the SCDE and pathways in WikiPathways.
