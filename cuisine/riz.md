## Riz indien épicé aux noix de cajoux et raisins

 * [Spicy Indian rice](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3238/spicy-indian-rice).

Ingredients:

 * a mugful of American long grain rice
 * 2 onions, sliced
 * 2 tbsp sunflower oil
 * ½ tsp turmeric
 * 1 cinnamon stick
 * 6 cardamom pods
 * 1 tsp cumin seeds
 * large handful of sultanas and roasted cashew nuts

Steps:

 1. Fry the onions in the sunflower oil in a large frying pan for 10-12 minutes until golden.
 2. Fill a roomy saucepan with water, bring to the boil and tip in a heaped teaspoon of salt - the water will bubble furiously. Add turmeric and the cinnamon stick to the water. Pour in the rice, stir once and return to the boil, then turn the heat down a little so that the water is boiling steadily, but not vigorously. Boil uncovered, without stirring (this makes for sticky rice) for 10 minutes. Lift some out with a slotted spoon and nibble a grain or two. If they're too crunchy, cook for another minute and taste again. They should be tender but with a little bite. Drain the rice into a large sieve and rinse by pouring over a kettle of very hot water
 3. Stir the crushed seeds of the cardamom pods into the onions with the cumin seeds and fry briefly.
 4. Toss in a large handful of sultanas and roasted cashew nuts, then the hot drained rice. This is great with curry and will also give an exotic edge to grilled meat or fish.

## Riz bastami indien

 * [Vegan Indian Basmati Rice Recipe](https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-vegan-indian-basmati-rice-recipe-3378479).

Ingredients:

 * 1 cup basmati rice (uncooked)
 * Water for soaking
 * 2 Tbsp olive oil (or peanut oil)
 * 1-inch cinnamon stick (broken in half)
 * 1 bay leaf
 * 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
 * 1 whole clove (you can use 2 to 3 if you really like cloves)
 * 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns
 * 1 large onion (chopped thin)
 * 1 cup basmati rice
 * 2 cups water
 * 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)

Steps:

 1. Cover the Basmati rice with water in a small bowl and set aside. Allow the rice to soak for 20 minutes.
 2. Once the rice is done soaking (after 20 minutes), drain any excess water and move on to the next step.
 3. Over medium heat, warm the olive oil or peanut oil in a sauté pan or large skillet and add the cinnamon stick (break it in half), bay leaf, cumin seeds, whole clove and peppercorns. Warm these spices for just 10 to 15 seconds, then add the chopped onion and heat until the onion is well cooked, about 6 to 8 minutes.
 4. Add the soaked but uncooked Basmati rice, and toast, stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds, just until lightly browned, then add the water and bring to a boil.
 5. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to a low simmer, cover, and allow the rice to cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until rice is cooked through and liquid is absorbed. You can stir occasionally, as needed.
